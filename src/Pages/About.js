         <p class=" text-justify" >Hey there, I am Rashmi Arya, pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering. In this project, I made a population website which shows population growth , its impact on our lives, and how to reduce it. It also shows the increase or decrease in the pollution of all the cities in the world. I made all this using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and ReactJS. I also used an API to fetch the data of different countries and cities and used graphs to show the population of a city in a particular year. I hope you like this. I will further add more functionalities to this website. </p>
